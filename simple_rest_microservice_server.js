/*
To run the microservice, use the script => npm run microservice

The npm script uses the npm library json-server to create a simple REST server running on localhost:3000 and is based on a json that represents data from a database.

Here is a list of all routes available on the auto-generated REST server: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#routes

Here are the routes we will be using for this tutorial
GET http://localhost:3000/astronauts => GET all astronauts
GET http://localhost:3000/astronauts/[id] => GET astronaut by id
GET http://localhost:3000/missions => GET all missions
